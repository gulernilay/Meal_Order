# Meal_Order

Project Objective:
The primary goal of this project is to enhance the user experience when ordering, with a focus on reducing difficulties and minimizing the ordering time. To achieve this, we have developed a straightforward yet efficient simulation system. The system operates as follows:

- Initial User Interaction:
   When users access the system, they are presented with two options: login and registration. Existing users can easily log in using their registered information. If the entered information matches the data stored in the system, the user gains access. For new users, there is a registration process to create a new account.

- Menu Selection:
   After successful login or registration, users are presented with a menu containing 7 categories. When a category is selected, the food options within that category are displayed. Users can effortlessly choose items and add them to their cart, along with the associated costs. To complete the ordering process, users can click on the "Complete the Order" button.

- Order Confirmation:
   The system then displays the total cost and requests confirmation of the order. If the user approves, the order is finalized. Otherwise, the menu screen is presented again for further adjustments.

**Additional Features to Be Implemented:
In addition to the core functionality described above, we plan to incorporate several additional features to further enhance the system:

- Multiple Payment Options:
   We intend to provide customers with multiple payment methods to choose from, making it convenient for them to pay for their orders.

- Order History for Registered Users:
   For registered users, we will implement a feature that allows them to view and reorder items from their previous orders. This history feature enhances user convenience and promotes repeat business.

3. **Random Menu Generator:**
   To assist users who have trouble deciding what to order, we will introduce a feature that generates a random menu selection. This feature adds an element of surprise and variety to the ordering process.

By incorporating these additional elements into our project, we aim to create a comprehensive and user-friendly system that simplifies the ordering process and improves customer satisfaction.
